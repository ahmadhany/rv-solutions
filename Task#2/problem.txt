Create a single page application using
Javascript or Typescript and a well-known
Javascript framework; React for preference but
Aurelia, Angular and JQuery are examples of
other acceptable frameworks:
a. The page contains three buttons in
separate areas of the page and single
image. Note that your buttons can be
anything and can all be of the same type
- the diagram is just a hint. The image
and each button must be packaged
separately; for example, discrete React
controls.
b. Clicking on a button displays a specific
image in the image area - each button
has a different image.
c. A button should give visual indication that it is currently selected or not
selected.
d. Clicking on the image cycles through the images and button states; for
example, image one displayed means that button one should be shown as
selected.
